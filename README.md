# mob-programming-essays

No daily stand-ups, no wait for code-reviews, no feeling alone.

One person controls the keyboard (typist), the rest of mob think and guides.

Make rotation periods (maybe 10 minutes), your turn as typist provides you mental relaxation because you can just obey.

Small teams (3 or 4 people) provides the best benefit-cost. In big teams the speak time of one person shrinks because everybody want to speak.

Group decision are superior over individual.

Continuous and implicit code reviews (no wait, no long lived branches and no context switches).

Rewarding flow: we never fell blocked by ourselves, it feels great.

Sharing knowledge.
